====================

Google app engine snippet holder.

Writing this mostly to test the functionality of google app engine and get to know it. So far it's been a great success in that regard as there is a lot of code already using the datastore, memcache and other functions.

If you want to learn how to use google app engine, I recommend reading somebodies code who know what they are doing (i.e. not me).

However, it also involves web development which I don't like quite so much.

In order to run this locally, you must download pygments and put it in the lib directory. All the libraries come ready shipped with google app engine so nothing to do there.

A copy of this application is being run online at [pad.mattdiesel.co.uk](http://pad.mattdiesel.co.uk/), it may be several versions behind.
